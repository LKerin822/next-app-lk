        <p>Hi, I'm Louise Kerin. I am an artist and designer based in Langwarrin, on the Mornington Peninsula, in Victoria.  My area of interest in art is around portraiture.  My portraiture journey began in graphite pencils which is a medium I still love to return to.  From there I moved into soft pastel and then acrylics.  The past few years I have mostly focused on creating digital art.  The main appeal with digital art is the portablily of materials.  I can, (and do!), take my iPad and pencil with me everywhere.  My design journey has taken me to studying for a Bachelor degree online with Curtin University. Should everything run smoothly, I should graduate later this year with a Bachelor of Arts: (Digital Experience and Interaction Design) and (Professional Writing and Publishing).</p>
